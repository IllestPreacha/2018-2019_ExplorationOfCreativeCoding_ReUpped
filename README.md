# ExplorationOfCreativeCoding

ChuCK- An Audio Based Programming language that has time built in to help concurrency and utilizes a mechanism called Shreds to handle the ability to work with live coding.

Haskell Summer Camp - Was a Nice exploration into why people use Haskell to build programming languages and the nuisances that occur when dealing with Functional Language paradigms and how some of the parsing works. Also we dived into examples of seeing reflex in action as this maintains a pipeline for Haskell to work on the front end.

Rain, Why are you Here - Showcasing how the OSC protocol allow programs of different styles in this case, Sonic-Pi (A ruby Dialect) in combination with Processing ( Java Dialect) can work in Unison

This Playlist shows different live coding environments and their nuisances in performances that highlight why they were made:
